# Real Time Bus Tracker

Overview:
This javascript app will give you live tracking of the Boston bus transit system.  The app pulls data from the boston transit website: https://api-v3.mbta.com/.  The app also uses mapbox to plot the bus locations.

How to run:
Drag the index.html file into your browser and the app will start pulling the data point from the API in 15 second increments

Future Updates:
1 Designate each marker with the appropriate bus title
2 Change the styling of each marker to more easily differentiate each bus
